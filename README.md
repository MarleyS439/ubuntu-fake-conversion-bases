- `hex n` - Convert a **decimal number into hexadecimal**, then `n` is number that would you like to convert.

## From Binary

- `bin2dec n` - Convert a **binary number into decimal**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

- `bin2octal n` - Convert a **binary number into octal**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

- `bin2hex n` - Convert a **binary number into hexadecimal**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

## From Hexadecimal

- `hex2dec n` - Convert a **hexadecimal number into decimal**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

- `hex2octal n` - Convert a **hexadecimal number into octal**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

- `hex2bin n` - Convert a **hexadecimal number into binary**, then `n` is a number that would you like to convert.

## From Octal
